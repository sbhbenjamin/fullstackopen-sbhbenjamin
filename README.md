![Course Completion Certificate](https://github.com/sbhbenjamin/fullstackopen-sbhbenjamin/blob/main/sbhbenjamin-certificate.png)
 
A submission repository for the [University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open 2021 course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), which teaches React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. This course introduces modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js

Over Winter 2021, I completed 7 ETCS credits, whereby I used 145 hours! It was truly an enriching experience where I could polish and refine my web development skills, and at the same time learn best practices and new technologies.
